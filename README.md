# Vim Configuration

This is my Vim configuration, stored on GitHub for safekeeping. It uses Vundle to manage plugins, but I do my best to use as few plugins as possible.

## Plugins

I use the following plugins currently.

* [VundleVim/Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) - Vundle
* [pangloss/vim-javascript](https://github.com/pangloss/vim-javascript) - JavaScript syntax highlighting with suport for ES6 and Flow
* [Valloric/YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe) - an autocompletion engine with C/C++ and JavaScript support

I do my best to stick with Vim's core features, so I don't rely on too many plugins to be productive.

## Install

Run `setup.sh`.
